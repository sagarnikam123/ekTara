### Marathi OS interface (Prototype)
  
## Description

- First Marathi OS interface (Prototype) on top of Windows using **Java**
- developed during post graduation program, **M.Sc.-Bioinformatics** (Semester-III) at **Bioinformatics Center, University of Pune, Pune** (India)

## Usage

- Run executable ekTar.jar
- password - ektara

## Version

0.1.0 - beta **(retired)**

**NOTE:** due to presence of similar concepts from CDAC's [BOSS](http://bosslinux.in/ "(Bharat Operating System Solutions")  &  [JNode](http://www.jnode.org/ "Java New Operating System Design Effort"), stops nurturing.

Now the project is in retired state. Further, New ideas & applicable concepts are always welcome.

## Contribution

- **Name of OS**
 - Ek Tara - The name is taken from an inspirational song sung by classmate  [Madhura Mohole](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/madhura-mohole/33/545/a05 "Linkedin") in practical lab, "Iktara" from movie "Wake up Sid !"
